# Method Process / Analysis:

By employing this comprehensive methodology, the AquaSafe project goals to generate actionable insights, foster collaboration, and drive positive change toward achieving universal access to clean and safe drinking water, improving health outcomes, and promoting sustainable development worldwide.

For a project like AquaSafe implemented in R, various libraries are essential to handle data manipulation, statistical analysis, machine learning, geospatial mapping, and visualization. Here's a refined list of commonly used libraries for each aspect of the project:
 
 The libraries used for each aspect of the project are: dplyr, tidyr, readr, data.table, stats, randonForest, caret, ggplot2. 
 
These libraries provide a robust toolkit for implementing AquaSafe, facilitating data-driven decision-making, community engagement, and policy advocacy initiatives to address the global water crisis.

```{r}
#We need to install these packages using the install.packages() function before loading them into your R environment using the library() function. Additionally, always check for the latest versions of these packages and update them regularly to ensure compatibility and access to new features.#Data preparation is crucial in any data analysis or machine learning project, including AquaSafe. 

# It involves cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming raw data into a suitable format for analysis and modeling. 

# Here's a detailed description of the data preparation process for the AquaSafe project:

libraries <- c("tidyverse", "dplyr", "readxl", "ggplot2", "caret", "rvest", "corrplot", "graphics", "gridExtra", "randomForest", "kernlab", "glmnet")

# Install and load libraries if not already installed
for (library in libraries) {
  if (!require(library, character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(library)
    library(library)
  }
}

# Data Collection: Gather data from various sources, including governmental agencies, NGOs, research institutions, and international organizations. 
# Collect datasets related to water sources, water quality parameters, health outcomes, socio-economic indicators, and environmental factors.
## I imported the dataset to this project.

# Read the entire data
#data <- read.csv("/cloud/project/JMP-WASH-in-health-care-facilities-2022-data-by-country_1).csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# Read the data
#data <- read.csv("/cloud/project/JMP-WASH-in-health-care-facilities-2022-data-by-country(1).csv", header = TRUE, skip = 1, na.strings = ".")
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/meatb/Downloads/JMP-WASH-in-health-care-facilities-2022-data-by-country.csv", header = TRUE, skip = 1, na.strings = ".")
str(data) #data object's structure. This provides information about the data types of each column and the first few values in each column, helping to understand the structure of the dataset.
view(data)

```
 
#Data Cleaning:

Handle Missing Values: 
Identify and handle missing values in the dataset. Depending on the extent of missing data, you may choose to impute missing values using techniques like mean imputation, interpolation, or predictive modeling or remove rows or columns with missing data.


•	Skipping Rows:
The first two rows of the dataset are skipped, likely because they contain headers or metadata that are not part of the actual data.
•	Converting Character Columns to Numeric:
Columns 3 to 45 are converted from character type to numeric type. This is achieved by using gsub to remove any non-numeric characters from each element in the selected columns, and then converting the result to numeric format. This step is necessary when the data in these columns is stored as characters but should be treated as numeric for analysis or modeling.
•	Rounding Numeric Columns: 
All numeric columns (3 to 45) are rounded to four decimal places. This step ensures consistency in precision across numeric values and may help reduce noise in the data.
•	Filtering Data for the Last 5 Years:
The unique years present in the dataset are identified, and the last five years are selected. This filtering step focuses the analysis on recent data, which may be more relevant for specific analyses or models.
•	Checking for observations in filtered data:
The code checks if there have been any observations in the filtered dataset for the last five years. If no observations are found, a message indicating the absence of data is printed. Otherwise, summary statistics for the filtered data are calculated and printed, providing insights into the distribution and characteristics of the data for the selected period.

Demonstrates common data preprocessing techniques, such as data type conversion, data filtering, and summary statistics calculation, which are essential steps in preparing data for analysis or modeling tasks.

```{r}

# Skip the first two rows
data <- data[-c(1:2), ]

# Convert columns 3 to 45 from character to numeric
data[, 3:45] <- sapply(data[, 3:45], function(x) as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9.-]", "", x)))

# Round numeric columns to 4 decimals
data[, 3:45] <- round(data[, 3:45], 4)

#Filter the data for the last 5 years
unique_years <- unique(data$Year)
print(unique_years)  # Print unique years for debugging

last_5_years <- tail(unique_years, 5)
data_last_5_years <- data[data$Year %in% last_5_years, ]

# Check if any observations exist in the filtered data
if (nrow(data_last_5_years) == 0) {
  print("No observations found for the last 5 years.")
} else {
  # Calculate summary statistics for the filtered data
  summary_stats <- summary(data_last_5_years)
  print(summary_stats)
}

```

#Data Integration:

Ensure Consistency: Check for consistency in variable names, data formats, and units across different datasets. 

Standardize variable names and units to ensure compatibility.

#Data Transformation:

Feature Engineering: Create new variables or features that may be informative for the analysis, such as aggregations, transformations, or interactions between existing variables.

Data Encoding: If necessary for modeling purposes, encode categorical variables into a numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Scaling and Normalization: Scale numerical variables to a similar range and normalize distributions to improve model performance and convergence.


```{r}

# Define new column names
new_column_names <- c("Country", "Year", "Population", "% Urban", "National Basic Water Services", "National Limited Water Services", "National No Water Service" )

# Assign new column names to your dataset
names(data) <- new_column_names

# Print column names of the dataset
column_names <- names(data)
print(column_names)

# Selecting specific columns
selected_data <- data[c("Year", "Population", "% Urban", "National Basic Water Services", "National Limited Water Services", "National No Water Service")]

# Check the structure of the selected data
str(selected_data)

```

Establishes the process of renaming columns, selecting specific columns of interest, and verifying the structure of the selected data, which are everyday data transformation tasks in data analysis and preparation workflows.

The following plots provide different visualizations of the data, allowing for a better understanding and interpretation of the relationships between variables and distributions of values. Each plot serves a specific purpose in exploring and analyzing the dataset.

```{r}
# Time series plot of Population over the years (blue color)
plot(selected_data$Year, selected_data$Population, type = "l", xlab = "Year", ylab = "Population", main = "Population Over Time", col = "blue")
#This code creates a simple time series plot showing how the population changes over the years, with each point representing a specific year and its corresponding population size.

# Histogram of Population (green color)
hist(selected_data$Population, xlab = "Population", main = "Distribution of Population", col = "green")

#This code creates a histogram that visualizes the distribution of the population data, showing the frequency or density of population values across different ranges or bins. Each bar represents a range of population values, and the height of the bar indicates the frequency or density of data points falling within that range.

# Scatter plot of % Urban vs. Population (red color)
plot(selected_data$Population, selected_data$`% Urban`, xlab = "Population", ylab = "% Urban", main = "Population vs. % Urban", col = "red")

#This code creates a scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between the total population and the percentage of urban population. Each point in the plot represents a data point corresponding to a specific combination of total population and urban population percentage. The color of the points is set to red for better visibility and distinction from other elements in the plot.

# Scatter plot of National Basic Water Services vs. Population (purple color) with switched axes
plot(selected_data$`National Basic Water Services`, selected_data$Population, 
     xlab = "National Basic Water Services", ylab = "Population", 
     main = "National Basic Water Services vs. Population", col = "purple")

#This code creates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between "National Basic Water Services" and "Population," with the data points colored in purple.

# Need to adjust the column names based on your actual data
# 'Country' column contains country names
# 'Year' column contains the year
# 'National_Basic_Water', 'National_Limited_Water', 'National_No_Water' are the water service indicators


# Define the function to create the plot for each water service indicator
plot_water_service <- function(service_name) {
  ggplot(data, aes(x = Year, y = !!sym(service_name), group = Country, color = Country)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(x = "Year", y = service_name, title = paste("Trend of", service_name, "over Time")) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = "none")  # Hide legend for clarity if there are too many countries
}

# Filter data for the desired range (2000 to 2022)
filtered_data <- subset(data, Year >= 2000 & Year <= 2022)

# Create scatter plot
plot(filtered_data$Year, filtered_data$`National Basic Water Services`, 
     col = "blue", pch = 16, main = "Scatter Plot of Year vs. National Basic Water Services",
     xlab = "Year", ylab = "National Basic Water Services")

# Convert Year and National No Water Service columns to numeric (if not already)
data$`National No Water Service` <- as.numeric(data$`National No Water Service`)

# Define the bin width
bin_width <- 5

# Create bins for the numeric range
bins <- seq(0, 65, by = bin_width)

# Create a new data frame with the binned data
data_binned <- data.frame(
  bin = cut(data$`National No Water Service`, breaks = bins, include.lowest = TRUE, right = FALSE),
  count = 1
)

# Aggregate the counts within each bin
data_aggregated <- aggregate(count ~ bin, data = data_binned, sum)

# Create a bar chart for the binned data
ggplot(data_aggregated, aes(x = bin, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +  # Bar chart with blue bars
  labs(title = "Distribution of National No Water Service",
       x = "Range 0-65",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

```

#Split Dataset: 
Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train machine learning models, the validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

Stratified Sampling: Ensure that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes or characteristics as the original dataset, especially if dealing with imbalanced classes.

Describes the process of splitting the data into training and testing sets using the caret package in R. 

Splitting the data into training and testing sets is a fundamental step in supervised machine learning tasks for model training and evaluation.

By meticulously executing these data preparation steps, AquaSafe can ensure the integrity, quality, and suitability of the data for subsequent analysis and modeling tasks, thereby enhancing the project's effectiveness in addressing the global water crisis.

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
train_index <- createDataPartition(selected_data$Year, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train_data <- selected_data[train_index, ]
test_data <- selected_data[-train_index, ]

# Remove rows with missing values
train_data <- na.omit(train_data)
test_data <- na.omit(test_data)


# Check the dimensions of the training and testing sets
dim(train_data)
dim(test_data)


```
#Data Exploration:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform exploratory analysis to gain insights into the data distribution, relationships between variables, and potential patterns or trends. Visualize key statistics, distributions, and relationships using histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps.

#Model building:

It is a pivotal phase in the AquaSafe project, where machine learning algorithms are trained to forecast water quality, evaluate health risks, and inform decision-making processes. Here's a tailored guide to model building based on our codes:

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using cross-validation, including model training and evaluation. Let's break it down step by step:

#Linear regression model:

Training a linear regression model, evaluating its performance using cross-validation, and visually inspecting its predictions against actual values during the exploratory data analysis phase.


```{r}
# Define cross-validation parameters
ctrl <- trainControl(method = "cv",  # Cross-validation method ("cv" for k-fold cross-validation)
                     number = 10,    # Number of folds
                     verboseIter = TRUE)  # Display iteration progress

# Specify the model and perform cross-validation
# For example, let's use a linear regression model
model <- train(Population ~ .,    # Formula: dependent variable ~ independent variables
               data = train_data,  # Training data
               method = "lm",     # Model type (e.g., "lm" for linear regression)
               trControl = ctrl)  # Cross-validation control parameters

# Print the cross-validation results
print(model)

# Make predictions on the training data
train_predictions <- predict(model, newdata = train_data)

# Plot actual vs. predicted values for the training data
plot(train_data$Population, train_predictions, 
     xlab = "Actual Population", ylab = "Predicted Population", 
     main = "Actual vs. Predicted Population (Training Data)",
     col = "blue", pch = 16)

# Add a diagonal line representing perfect predictions
abline(a = 0, b = 1, col = "red")

# Add legend
legend("topleft", legend = c("Actual vs. Predicted", "Perfect Prediction"),
       col = c("blue", "red"), pch = c(16, NA), lty = c(NA, 1))

#The summary provided indicates the results of a linear regression model:

```
#Training a linear regression model, evaluating its performance using cross-validation, and visually inspecting its predictions against actual values during the exploratory data analysis phase.

#Random Forest model:

The process of training a Random Forest model, evaluating its performance through cross-validation, and visually inspecting the model's predictions against actual values during the exploratory data analysis phase.



```{r}
# Specify the model and perform cross-validation
model_rf <- train(Population ~ .,    # Formula: dependent variable ~ independent variables
                  data = train_data,  # Training data
                  method = "rf",     # Model type (Random Forest)
                  trControl = ctrl)  # Cross-validation control parameters

# Print the cross-validation results
print(model_rf)

# Plot the cross-validation results
if (length(model_rf$control$index) > 1) {
  plot(model_rf)
} else {
  cat("No tuning parameters to plot.\n")
}

# Make predictions on the training data
train_predictions_rf <- predict(model_rf, newdata = train_data)

# Plot actual vs. predicted values for the training data
plot(train_data$Population, train_predictions_rf, 
     xlab = "Actual Population", ylab = "Predicted Population", 
     main = "Actual vs. Predicted Population (Random Forest - Training Data)",
     col = "blue", pch = 16)

# Add a diagonal line representing perfect predictions
abline(a = 0, b = 1, col = "red")

# Add legend
legend("topleft", legend = c("Actual vs. Predicted", "Perfect Prediction"),
       col = c("blue", "red"), pch = c(16, NA), lty = c(NA, 1))



```
This visualization visualizes how well the Random Forest model predicts population values by comparing the actual and predicted values in a scatter plot, with a diagonal line indicating perfect predictions.

o	A scatter plot is generated to visualize the relationship between the actual population values (train_data$Population) and the predicted population values (train_predictions_rf).

#Linear Support Vector Machine:

Train a linear support vector machine model, makes predictions on the test data, visualizes the actual vs. predicted population values, and attempts to print the model summary. 

```
```{r}

#Specify the model and perform cross-validation
model_svm <- train(Population ~ .,    # Formula: dependent variable ~ independent variables
                   data = train_data,  # Training data
                   method = "svmLinear",     # Model type (e.g., "svmLinear" for linear support vector machine)
                   trControl = ctrl)  # Cross-validation control parameters

# Make predictions on the test data
predictions <- predict(model_svm, newdata = test_data)

# Plot actual vs. predicted
plot(test_data$Population, predictions, xlab = "Actual Population", ylab = "Predicted Population", main = "Actual vs. Predicted Population")
print(model)


## best model Random Forest.

# Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search
# Example: Tune hyperparameters of the Random Forest model
tuned_model_rf <- train(Population ~ .,
                        data = train_data,
                        method = "rf",
                        trControl = ctrl,
                        tuneGrid = data.frame(mtry = c(2, 3, 5)))

# Plot the performance metrics across different values of mtry
plot(tuned_model_rf)

# Plot only RMSE and R-squared
plot(tuned_model_rf$results$mtry, tuned_model_rf$results$RMSE, type = "l", col = "blue", xlab = "mtry", ylab = "RMSE", main = "RMSE vs. mtry")
lines(tuned_model_rf$results$mtry, tuned_model_rf$results$Rsquared, type = "l", col = "red")
legend("topright", legend = c("RMSE", "R-squared"), col = c("blue", "red"), lty = 1)


0000000
```
Trains a linear support vector machine model, makes predictions on the test data, visualizes the actual vs. predicted population values, and attempts to print the model summary.

# Results: Model Interpretation and Evaluation:

In the AquaSafe project, model interpretation, and evaluation are critical steps in understanding the predictive capabilities of machine learning models and assessing their performance in achieving the project objectives of improving access to clean water and mitigating health risks associated with contaminated water sources. Here's how model interpretation and evaluation are conducted:

To provide an analysis of the code and project for machine learning, we need to understand the context and objectives of the project, as well as the specific data and models used. Here's a general analysis based on the provided code snippets:

Objective:
The project objective is a machine learning-based analysis of data related to water service indicators over time for different countries. The code includes data preprocessing, model training using various algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forest, support vector machines), cross-validation, and performance evaluation.

2.	Data Preprocessing:
o	The code reads the data from a CSV file. It performs basic preprocessing steps such as converting character columns to numeric, rounding numeric columns, and filtering data for the last five years.
o	Missing values are handled using na.omit() to remove rows with missing data.

3.	Model Training and Evaluation:
o	The code utilizes several machine learning algorithms including linear regression, random forest, and support vector machines for modeling.
o	Cross-validation with 10 folds (cv method) is used to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.
o	Performance metrics such as RMSE, R-squared, and MAE are calculated for each model during cross-validation.

4.	Visualization:
o	Plots are generated to visualize the models' performance, including actual vs. predicted population, residual plot, and plots showing model optimization results.
o	The code attempts to plot tuning parameter results for each model but encounters errors in cases with only one tuning parameter.

5.	Analysis:
o	The analysis involves comparing the performance metrics (RMSE, R-squared, MAE) of different models (linear regression, random forest, SVM) to determine the best-performing model for predicting population based on the available predictors.
o	Based on the provided results, further analysis could involve feature importance analysis (for models like a random forest), identifying influential predictors, and interpreting model coefficients (for linear regression).
The provided code demonstrates a structured machine learning model development and evaluation approach. Further refinement and analysis could enhance the predictive accuracy and interpretability of the models.
To determine which model is better, we compare their performance metrics, such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), R-squared, and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) obtained during cross-validation.

Looking at the results provided:

1.	Linear Regression:
o	RMSE: 96,950.7
o	R-squared: 0.03484666
o	MAE: 39,660.32

2.	Random Forest:
o	RMSE: 26,672.03
o	R-squared: 0.8907296
o	MAE: 9,600.331

3.	Support Vector Machines (Linear Kernel):
o	RMSE: 98,363.14
o	R-squared: 0.03990532
o	MAE: 29,708.3

Based on these metrics, the Random Forest model performs better. It has the lowest RMSE and MAE, indicating better predictive accuracy.

Additionally, it has the highest R-squared value, suggesting that the model explains more variance in the data compared to the other models. Therefore, the Random Forest model is the better choice in this comparison.

Random Forest: RMSE was used to select the optimal model using the smallest value.

Linear regression 
Indicates the results of a linear regression model:
•	Number of Samples: 670
•	Predictors: 5
•	Pre-processing: No pre-processing
•	Resampling Method: Cross-Validated (10 fold)
•	Summary of Sample Sizes: Varies across folds
•	Resampling Results:
o	RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error
o	Rsquared: R-squared (coefficient of determination)
o	MAE: Mean Absolute Error

The model's performance seems summarized across 10 folds of cross-validation, with metrics such as RMSE, Rsquared, and MAE reported. The tuning parameter 'intercept' was held constant at a value of TRUE, indicating that the intercept term was included in the model.

These metrics provide insights into how well the model fits the data and its predictive performance.

Random Forest 

•	707 samples
•	  5 predictors
•	No pre-processing
•	Resampling: Cross-Validated (10-fold) 
•	Summary of sample sizes: 635, 636, 637, 638, 636, 638, ... 
•	Resampling results across tuning parameters:
•	
•	  mtry  RMSE      Rsquared   MAE      
•	  2     37603.45  0.8827188  12431.176
•	  3     29238.11  0.8913999   9712.102
•	  5     20154.90  0.9187151   7503.671

RMSE was used to select the optimal model using the smallest value.

The final value used for the model was mtry = 5.
The Random Forest model with mtry = 5 demonstrates strong performance in predicting the population based on the selected predictor variables. It achieves low RMSE, high Rsquared, and low MAE, indicating accurate predictions and a good fit to the data.

Linear Regression 
•	707 samples
•	  5 predictor
•	No pre-processing
•	Resampling: Cross-Validated (10 fold) 
•	Summary of sample sizes: 635, 637, 635, 637, 636, 638, ... 
•	Resampling results:
•	RMSE      Rsquared    MAE     
•	 105322.4  0.03163578  44830.57

The tuning parameter 'intercept' was held constant at a value of TRUE

The analysis highlights the limitations of the linear regression model in accurately predicting the population based on the selected predictor variables. Further exploration and refinement of the modeling approach are necessary to develop a more accurate predictive model.
